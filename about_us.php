            <br><br> Our tutors can address any special needs and work to ensure that the pupil is getting help in those areas that need the most attention. 
        Due to the class size at schools, a pupil may keep his doubt within himself to avoid any embarrassment in front of his classmates. 
        Hence, a pupil would be more open towards his tutor than his school teacher.
